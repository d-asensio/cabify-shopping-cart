# Cabify Coding Challenge - Shopping Cart

This document attempts to explain the big picture of the code and the architecture it follows, and also give insight about the intentions behind it. Thank you for taking the time to read and review.

## Introduction

To write quality software one has to find the right balance between business needs and mid-to-long term code maintainability. It's everything about understanding the context, not only the technical context but also and more important: The product context.

## Product context

The fact that this is a code challenge and not a real product does not mean that there is no context. The description of the exercise highlights three aspects that are considered valuable:

- **Deliver production-ready code:** This means that the code must be reliable, or in other words, it must have tests.
- **Provide a solution that could be easy to grow and easy to add new functionality:** Which means that the code must be easily extensible on the arrival of new business needs, or in other words, maintainable.
- **We value succinctness:** Which means that the product must be simple, or in other words, it must be an MVP that will be useful to validate the business model.

But these are general considerations. To understand the context we have to focus on the nature of the product, what we know about similar products, and how it will likely evolve in future iterations if it was supposed to suit a real case scenario.

Acting as a product owner this is what I think is prone to change in a product like this (mini online store):

- The price of the products
- Discount rules

So the priority should go in this direction when it comes to defining the boundaries of the code architecture.

## Technical context

The technical context is more open in this case, this is a greenfield project so there is no legacy code, and the only person involved in the "development team" is me, so the choice of technologies, techniques, etc. will be very opinionated and not open to debate, which would be the healthier thing to do when working in real life.

## Technologies of choice

I made my choices taking into account the product needs, striving for fast development to produce maintainable, reliable, and clean code.

- **React:** I will be using React to develop this because it is the library for building UI interfaces that I know the most and it has a great ecosystem, however it comes with some drawbacks (like any other thing out there) and I am aware of those (performance, bundle size, etc.) but I think that for this project those are more than reasonable.

- **Styled-components:** CSS-in-JS is controversial I know, but it is good for fast-paced development, simplifies a lot the building toolset, and helps in writing semantic and understandable code. I think it is ideal for this project since it is small and the drawback of the bundle size will not be noticeable. In a different project with different needs, I would probably use SASS with a BEMIT architecture, I am pretty comfy working this way as well.

- **Redux with redux-toolkit:** redux-toolkit provides useful defaults like `createReducer` that uses [immer](https://github.com/immerjs/immer) to mutate the state, which leads to cleaner code.

## Architecture highlights

This section is divided into three parts: [Checkout class](#checkout-class), [App state](#app-state) and [Checkout and app link](#checkout-and-app-link).

### Checkout class

The Checkout class contains the business logic of the app, it is initialized with the pricing rules that will dictate the final price of the selected products.

> You can find the implementation of the checkout class under the `src/checkout` directory.

#### Pricing rules

The pricing rules are defined as an object containing products and discounts:

```js
const pricingRules = {
    products: [
      {
        id: 'TSHIRT',
        name: 'Shirt',
        code: 'X7R2OPX',
        price: 20.00
      },
      {
        id: 'MUG',
        name: 'Mug',
        code: 'X7R2OPY',
        price: 5.00
      },
      {
        id: 'CAP',
        name: 'Cap',
        code: 'X7R2OPZ',
        price: 10.00
      }
    ],
    discounts: [
      {
        type: 'BUY_1_GET_2',
        name: '2x1 Mug offer',
        options: {
          entitledProductId: 'MUG'
        }
      },
      {
        type: 'BULK_PERCENTAGE',
        name: 'x3 Shirt offer',
        options: {
          entitledProductId: 'TSHIRT',
          percentage: -5,
          minimumSelectionQuantity: 3
        }
      }
    ]
  }
```

The important thing to notice here is that discounts have `type` and `options` properties. Those properties are used to invoke a specific `DiscountRules` class that is created through a `DiscountRulesFactory`.

A code example should shed some light on this:

```js
const discountRules = DiscountRulesFactory.create('BUY_1_GET_2', {
  entitledProductId: 'MUG'
})

console.log(discountRules instanceof DiscountRulesBuy1Get2)
// --> true

// OR

const discountRules = DiscountRulesFactory.create('BULK_PERCENTAGE', {
    entitledProductId: 'TSHIRT',
    percentage: -5,
    minimumSelectionQuantity: 3
  }
})

console.log(discountRules instanceof DiscountRulesBulkPercentage)
// --> true
```

`DiscountRulesBuy1Get2` and `DiscountRulesBulkPercentage` are classes that share a common interface: Both receive a `options` object as the single constructor parameter and have a public method `calculateFor(products)` that calculates the discounted amount from a list of `Product`s.

As an example of that interface using the `DiscountRulesBuy1Get2` discount rules:

```js
const mugProduct = new Product({
  id: 'MUG',
  name: 'Mug',
  code: 'X7R2OPY',
  price: 5.00
})

mugProduct.selectedQuantity = 2

const discountAmout = discountRules.calculateFor([
  mugProduct
])

console.log(discountAmout)
// --> -5
```

This pattern is very desirable in this case. Heading back to the [product context](#product-context) section, I stated that the discount rules are prone to change, and this architecture will make the code comply with the [openâ€“closed principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle), allowing us to add more discount types only by adding new code, reducing in this way the risk of introducing new bugs in future modifications.

### App state

The app is responsible for handling the user input and updating the state that **can be derived from that input without applying any business logic**. However this statement can be intricate, it is easier to understand with an image:

![](assets/figure-1-app-user-input-derived-state.png)

The derived state, in this case, should respond to the answers:

- How many `TSHIRT` products did the user select?
- What is the total selected product quantity?
- What is the price of the selected `MUG` products?
- What is the total price of the user selection (before apply discounts)?

And the questions that it should not answer:

- What are the discounts that apply for the current selection?
- What is the grand total of the purchase?

Having explained which are the responsibilities of the app, let's dive into how these responsibilities are fulfilled.

#### Handling user input

The user input is handled by the `Stepper` component that is composed of an input element of type number and two buttons. This will allow the user to increment or decrement the quantity of each product one-by-one by using the buttons, or directly write the desired amount to the input.

> The implementation of the Stepper component can be found in `src/app/components/Stepper.js`

Here is an example of usage for this component:

```js
function Counter () {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(0)

  return (
    <Stepper
      value={value}
      onChange={newValue => setValue(newValue)}
      onDecrease={() => setValue(value - 1)}
      onIncrease={() => setValue(value + 1)}
    />
  )
}
```

There are two important things to notice here:

 - It is a controlled component
 - It does not implement a mechanism to increase or decrease the value, so the decision of how to react to the `onDecrease` and `onIncrease` is left to the consumer.

 The reason behind this design decision is **reusability**, while it is true that this component has a specific behavior in this application, it is potentially useful for another application or even for future features of this one.
 
 The component could implement the increasing/decreasing logic internally and just expose the `onChange` handler that would provide always the updated `newValue`, but this will force us to modify the component when new requirements come.

 Regarding the example above, consider a new requirement from the product owner:

 > The quantity must be increased or decreased in steps of 10 if the user is pressing the shift key while clicking the buttons.

 It is considerably easier to implement, if the component do not have to be modified, and less risk is introduced:

 ```js
function Counter () {
  const [value, setValue] = useState(0)
  const isShiftPressed = useKeyPressed('shift')

  const incrementStep = isShiftPressed ? 10 : 1

  return (
    <Stepper
      value={value}
      onChange={newValue => setValue(newValue)}
      onDecrease={() => setValue(value - incrementStep)}
      onIncrease={() => setValue(value + incrementStep)}
    />
  )
}
```

This is an example of the [dependency inversion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle) applied to react components, reviewing the principle statement:

> High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g. interfaces).
>
> **From Wikipedia**

The high-level module in our example is the `Counter` component and the low-level is the `Stepper` component, the first's logic does not depend on the latter, they communicate through an event-based interface.

To conclude, I would like to remark on an implementation detail of the `Stepper` component. It uses a custom hook `useControlledInputNumber` to sanitize the input of the user by enforcing numerical values while allowing to edit the input. I think it could be useful for other people so I extracted it from this codebase and open-sourced it. You can find more details about it [here](https://github.com/d-asensio/use-controlled-input-number).

#### Updating the state

The state of the application is managed with [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux), as aforementioned in the [technologies of choice](#technologies-of-choice) section it is used in tandem with [redux-toolkit](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit) that is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic. But this is superficial, the interesting part to explain here is how the state is modeled to describe the information that our application needs to operate.

```js
const state = {
  isLoadingProducts: false,
  productsById: {
    TSHIRT: {
      id: 'TSHIRT',
      name: 'Shirt',
      code: 'X7R2OPX',
      price: 20,
      imageSrc: 'images/thumbnails/shirt.png'
    },
    MUG: {
      id: 'MUG',
      name: 'Mug',
      code: 'X2G2OPZ',
      price: 5,
      imageSrc: 'images/thumbnails/mug.png'
    },
    CAP: {
      id: 'CAP',
      name: 'Cap',
      code: 'X3W2OPY',
      price: 10,
      imageSrc: 'images/thumbnails/cap.png'
    }
  },
  productCountersById: {
    TSHIRT: 3,
    MUG: 3,
    CAP: 2
  },
  discounts: [
    {
      name: '2x1 Mug offer',
      amount: -5
    },
    {
      name: 'x3 Shirt offer',
      amount: -3
    }
  ],
  grandTotal: 87
}
```

The product information and the counters are separated parts of the state, which is useful because when it comes to update the quantity of a product, the reducer only have to mutate the `productCountersById` object, which makes the code very simple and safer because the `productsById` object remains untouched:

```js
export function updateProductCounter (state, { payload }) {
  const { productCountersById } = state
  const { id, quantity } = payload

  if (quantity < 0) return

  productCountersById[id] = quantity
}
```

Once the state is updated, any subscribed component gets notified and re-renders if necessary to show the new information. But the components do not access the state directly, they use selectors to get the information they need, either if this information is accessible in a direct way or it has to be processed.

This pattern creates a contract between the components and the state and provides flexibility and robustness since it allows to modify components without having to modify the state and vice-versa.

### Checkout and app link

I have described the checkout class and the app, but how they link together?

In my opinion, the frontend should be as "dummy" as possible: It should contain the minimum amount of business logic as possible and in case that this is unavoidable, the business logic should be isolated from the presentation layer.

For this reason, I think that the checkout class should not be used directly from the reducers and thus it should be considered as an external service. Just like if we had an endpoint of an API that we could use to calculate the discounts and the final price of the user selection.

This is not a wild idea and probably as our little store grows and we start to have tens of discount rules this logic will probably be migrated to the backend and exposed through an API endpoint.

With this possibility in mind, I have created the checkout service, which is a [facade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern) between the application, the checkout class, and the price rules data.

> The implementation of the checkout service can be found in `src/app/services/initCheckoutService.js`

This service can be easily modified to get discounts and total price information from an API endpoint or any other data source that we want, without having to modify any other part of the application.

This is an example of how to use it:

```js
const checkoutService = initCheckoutService()

;(async () => {
  const products = await checkoutService.getAvailableProducts()

  console.log(products)
  // -> [{ id: 'MUG', ... }, { id: 'TSHIRT', ... }, ...]

  const selectedProducts = [
    { id: 'MUG', quantity: 3 },
    { id: 'TSHIRT', quantity: 2 }
  ]

  const summary = await checkoutService.getSummaryForSelection(selectedProducts)

  console.log(summary)
  // -> { 
  //   discounts: [{ name: 'x3 Shirt offer', amount: -5 }],
  //   total: 30
  // }
})()
```

> The `initCheckoutService` function uses the [revealing module pattern](https://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#revealingmodulepatternjavascript) to provide private and public encapsulation by taking advantage of the javascript scope rules.

Once created, the `checkoutService` can be used to get the available products and to calculate the summary given an array with the selected products.

> Is worth to mention that this service will fetch the data of the products and discounts through the network, but I have not developed an API, I just used the `copy-webpack-plugin` to copy the contents of the `data` folder to the build directory and thus the json files that are placed there will be served as part of the bundle.

To update the state with the data returned from the service I use [redux-saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/) and every time that the `updateProductCounter` action is dispatched, a saga hits the service to get the summary information and dispatches an action to update the state with the returned information. This is done this way because the checkout service could potentially be connected to an external data source so it can not be considered pure, the output can not be determined from the input since the API behavior is opaque from the application point of view.

To make this process efficient, the `checkoutService` memoizes any fetched data so it will only fetch the required data once.
